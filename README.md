>[!IMPORTANT]
>This project is WIP, and does not completely implement features such as user authentication or protection against injection attacks, and is therefore not intended for actual use.  Various unintended bugs and errors may occur.

The files contained in this repository reference a server that is no longer active, and as such will not function as intended.  This repository only serves as an avenue to inspect the codebase.

## Future updates
- Move codebase to active server
- User authentication
- Favoriting shows and riders
- Increased security
- Update home page
- Improve functionality
